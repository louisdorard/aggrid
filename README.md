## Codespaces

This repo includes a devcontainer config and can be used in Codespaces.

Secrets have already been defined and can be used by collaborators; they allow access to a Dataiku design node:

* `DKU_DSS_URL`
* `DKU_API_KEY`

TODO: Install `dataiku` package (downloadable from the Dataiku instance)
